I’m a Research Scientist working on LLMs, with a PhD focused on Benchmarking and Evaluating of LLMs across languages. Over the past years, I’ve worked on multilingual dialogue evaluation and safety alignment, focusing on benchmarking, and fine-tuning strategies to improve LLM-judges. 

Currently interested in driving end-to-end work on LLM evaluation, multilingual conversational agents, and reliability. I'm also super interested in how to incorporate diversity and personalisation in LLM assessments. If your team is tackling challenges around these topics, I’d be happy to connect!
